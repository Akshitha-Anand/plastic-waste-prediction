# Plastic Production & Waste Prediction

## Overview
Predict plastic waste generation using production data to aid environmental monitoring and pollution control.

## Dataset
- Plastic waste per country: Kaggle
- plastic-waste-generation : Kaggle

## Completed (30%)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned datasets saved
- Visualizations: Production vs Waste, Top 10 countries by waste

## Next Steps
- Merge with GDP/population data
- Build regression models to predict plastic waste
- Evaluate and visualize predictions
