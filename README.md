# Plastic Production & Waste Prediction

## Overview
Predict plastic waste generation using production data to aid environmental monitoring and pollution control.

## Dataset
- Plastic waste per country: Kaggle
- plastic-waste-generation : Kaggle

## Completed 
Dataset loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Head, info, correlation matrix, visualizations

Data Preprocessing
Drop missing values, feature-target selection

Model Implementation
Linear Regression model trained on the data

Model Evaluation
Metrics: MAE, MSE, RÂ²
Visualization: Actual vs Predicted

Model Saving & Inference
Save model as .pkl file
Example prediction with new data

## Next Steps
- Merge with GDP/population data
- Build regression models to predict plastic waste
- Evaluate and visualize predictions
